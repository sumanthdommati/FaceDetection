Face Detection using Webcam based on OpenCv
# Face Recognition Using Webcam

This Python script uses OpenCV and the face_recognition library to perform real-time face recognition using a webcam. It detects faces in the webcam feed, compares them with a known face stored as an image file, and labels them accordingly.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- face_recognition (`face-recognition`)


## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `face_recognition_webcam.py` file.
2. Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer.
3. Run the script using the following command:
4. The webcam feed will open, and faces detected in the feed will be labeled with the name specified in the script (`known_face_names`).
5. To exit the program, press 'q' on your keyboard.

## Customization

- You can customize the known face by changing the image file path (`image_file`) and the associated name (`known_face_names`).
- You can also customize the appearance of the detected faces by modifying the rectangle color, font, and text color in the script.
